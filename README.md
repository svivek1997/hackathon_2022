There are two sensors in this project( flame sensor and Temperature/humidity sensor) which detects the smoke or any inert gases released from the eqipment and record temperatures continuously. 

 R index works with the ESG to gather data in real time, report and add to a database to improve the accuracy and give a number to the effort companies are giving to reduce their emissions and carbon footprint. This will incentivise investment firms to prioritise investment in those companies that score well, and serve as a financial incentive to decarbonize faster and more efficiently compared to their peers in their industry (GICS 11 sectors).
 
 We Created a MangoDB Database(Stats) to store the results coming from Aurdino. we have simulated the results using mango charts.
 
 Using the simulations we define climate impacts caused by certain company over a period of time. This helps in awareness of Green Eco System.
